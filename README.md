# Replacing [Shapeoko Pro XL](https://shop.carbide3d.com/collections/machines/products/shapeoko-pro-cnc-router?variant=33007028797501) Crappy Stepper Drivers

## ... and ditching GRBL in favour of more advanced [UCCNC](https://cncdrive.com/UCCNC.html) Controller, using [UC100](https://cncdrive.com/UC100.html) USB interface to plug into this board.

Though hardly a surprise by now, the improved precision along with quieter, smoother and faster operation aforded by decent drivers never ceases to astonis h me. :-)
